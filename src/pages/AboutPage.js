            <h3>Orlando Ryan Rojas, L.Ac, LMT</h3>
            <p>Ryan is a New York State Licensed Acupuncturist, Massage Therapist, and Reiki Master. He uses this combination of healing techniques to bring a very unique, intuitive approach to his treatments and patient care.</p>
            <p>His path to healing began, ironically, through his practice of martial arts. While studying internal arts such as Tai Chi and Yoga, he grew curious about how to help others that crossed his path. This curiosity led him to begin his journey of holistic healing and creating balance in himself while helping others do the same.</p>
            <p>Ryan graduated from New York College of Health Professions for Massage Therapy and New York College of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Acupuncture. Over the course of his studies, and his life, he picked up certain values that he applies to his treatments. Bringing balance, attention to details, and approaching with sensitivity are just a few values that he focuses on.</p>
            <p>Every day he strives to both help and educate his patients, empowering them to live better and healthier lives.</p>
